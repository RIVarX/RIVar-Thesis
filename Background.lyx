, the fields calculations have similarities with reactive variables and
 FRP.
 In FRP the operations are lifted, so that once a variable or a field is
 assigned, it is accosiated to the assigned expression, to continuously
 re-evaluated according to relevant changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), given two reactive variables or fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE B$
\end_inset

 , the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=B+1}$
\end_inset

 associates 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE A$
\end_inset

 with the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{B+1}$
\end_inset

, and the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE A$
\end_inset

 changes in response to any input provided to the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE B$
\end_inset

.
 The accosiation establishes data dependencies, so that the left side variable
 depends on the variables in the right side.
 Naivly the left side should be recalculated in response to any change in
 any of the variables it depends on.

 Saying

 is a function with a body of

\begin_layout Standard
In programming frameworks, such as in web development, code that updates
 fields based on other fields can be registered to be executed when fields
 are changed.

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 means to execute

 The values can be generated from events generated from UI elements.
 Then functions like 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Select}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{CombineLatest}$
\end_inset

 create observables whose items are generated based on the values of input
 observables.

\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{B=D.Select(x=>x+1)}$
\end_inset

, each value in 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE D$

 is passed through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{x=>x+1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE B$

 Finally, by subscribing to the resulting observables, UI elements can be

This abstraction has several issue.
 First, in case of

\emph default
s, the behavior does not behave properly.
 For example, if the code contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A=D.Select(x=>x+1)}$
\end_inset

 and accidently it is added 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{D.Subscribe(val=>A.OnNext(val-1))}$
\end_inset

.
 It is like saying

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other problems are related to a phenomenon named 
\emph on
simultaneous events.
 
\emph default
In the default change propogation, observables synchronously respond to
 notifications by passing them forward.
 This traversal can be likened to a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm,
 where a change event initiates a sequence of computations in a depth-first
 order.
 The DFS algorithm can be described in terms of its result.
 This has the form of a
\emph on
 spanning tree
\emph default
 of the vertices reached during the traversal.
 This traversal order has the known issue named 
\emph on
glitch
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bainomugisha2013survey"
literal "false"

\end_inset


\emph on
.

\emph default
 Certain nodes may be visited multiple times, while some of these visits
 involving outdated values.
 For instance, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Glitch-1-1"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the spanning tree, resulting from the DFS traversal, contains nodes with
 more than one incoming edge.
 This implies that certain variables were updated multiple times in response
 to the change, but some of these updates relied on outdated values.
 The multiple incoming edges of a node represent simultaneous events, which
 are related to the same time, that originaly caused by a single event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similary in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{merge}$
\end_inset

 operator, the simultaneous events cause an incorrect behavior.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{merge}$
\end_inset

 operator creates an observable stream, where each item from any of the
 input streams triggers a corresponding item in the output stream.
 If two streams have items from the same time, originating from a single
 event, the resulting stream will contain it twice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues caused by accidental recursions, as well as simultaneous events,
 prevent the abstraction from being referential transparent.
 For recursions, this merely leads to infinite loops.
 For simultaneous events, it is not explicitly defined in what order the
 items should be generated.

ReactiveX, available in languages like C# and JavaScript through frameworks

 Observable streams are like a list, that produce the items.
 Field change events can be used to iniate an observable streams.
 and in the other hand, an observable can be subscriebd by visual elements
 to update values.
 The operators Select and CombineLatest creates observables, that their
 items are creatd in response to items in other observables, and based on
 their values.
 For exmaple, B=D.Select(x=>x+1), each value in D is executed by the function
 x=>x+1, and produe the result in D.

In addition to the more verbose syntax 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 achieved by events streams, the mechanism is very different.
 Functions over events streams are typicaly not handled by a special runtime
 with the graph data structure.
 Instead, the events streams are 
\emph on
observables
\emph default
, with 
\emph on
operators
\emph default
 over them, that subscribe and produce events streams.
 Accordingly objects can have reactive variables as part of their interface,
 while the values are propagated according to the events mechanism.
 Generally speaking, reactive variables as events streams does no depend
 on the madiator exists in the original FRP, because they interact directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The madiator has access to all the variables and formulas, so it can provide
 more predictable behavior.
 For example, if one variable has several updates caused by a single update,
 such as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Glitch"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, that updating 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{C}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In case that the variables interact directly, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{D}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will have an incorrect update named 
\emph on
glitch.
 
\emph default
In contrast, a madiator has the knowledge of the special construction to
 handle the updates correctly.
 So 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{D}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will be updated only when both

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

 has been updated.
 Even though the madiator can provide more predictable behavior, there are
 sometimes requirements that prefer directed interaction over a madiator.
 For example, typical distributed applications prefer directed interacton
 to reduce perfomance.

 The objects have methods, by which they are used.
 fields can be updated only by those methods.

Building Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of developing systems, reactive variables, streams, and events
 can be considered as building blocks or units that you can utilize to construct
 or implement reactive and event-driven functionality.
 They serve as fundamental concepts or tools that enable you to handle and
 propagate changes within your system.
 Here's a breakdown of their roles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Reactive Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Reactive variables provide a way to represent and manage data that automatically
 updates when dependent data changes.
 They are building blocks that allow you to define dependencies and establish
 reactive behavior within your system.
 Reactive variables enable you to express how data should react to changes
 and facilitate automatic propagation of updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Streams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Streams represent a sequence of data that can be processed incrementally
 or asynchronously.
 They serve as building blocks for modeling and transforming data flows
 within your system.
 Streams allow you to express the continuous flow of data and enable you
 to apply operations or transformations to the data as it moves through
 the stream pipeline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Events are mechanisms that allow components or entities within a system
 to communicate and react to specific occurrences or triggers.
 They serve as building blocks for handling and propagating notifications

 Events facilitate loose coupling and decoupled communication between components

By utilizing reactive variables, streams, and events as building blocks,
 you can develop systems that are responsive, flexible, and can effectively
 handle and propagate changes.
 These concepts provide the necessary foundations to build reactive, event-drive

This is like previous works had to face the balancing between the abstraction
 level and the generalism of the propogation algorithm.
 The technaogy that enables completely custom propogation, has a problematic
 abstraction.
 Event-driven programming theortecaly provide customizable propagation.
 Hoever, the paradigm is error prone, so that it hard to realy customize
 according to the needs.
 Therfore, it is not new that the customizability, is by only choose a general
 propogation strategy.

The OOP paradigm provides an alernative by the observer pattern.
 Objects can provide observers to register, to later execute tehri code,
 whenever variables are updated.
 Similary, objects can expose an OnChange event, that will be used to eceute
 code that update dependant variables.
 Cross systems, there are sometimes hooks, to call external code in response
 to a change in the data.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(I wrote this, and asked the gpt generate )The Observer pattern in Object-Orient
ed Programming (OOP) can adress the issue of interdependent fields in for
 front-end applications.
 Objects can contain variables that are equivalent to the fields in UI applicati
ons.
 By using the Observer pattern or events, it is possible to register code
 to be executed when a field or a variable is changed.
 Otherwise, code that update a variable (or a field) might be changed, to
 update other depedant variables.
 Instead, by t the observer pattern, we have the ability to hide logic,
 which can help to separate concerns and make code easier to manage.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Objects can use the observer pattern, or expose events to execute code when
 fields are updated, to enable other fields to be updated accordingly.
 If the code that updates one field needs to directly update additional
 fields, modifying the code to update one field might require changing the
 locations in the code where the other fields are updated.
 This leads to a centralized maintenance model, as seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Centerlized-Calculation"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where all the calculation logic is centralized and tightly coupled, making
 it difficult to isolate the code for each field.
 As an alternative, each field or variable has an onchange event, and multiple
 event handlers are registered, that update depedant fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, the onchange events did not effectively address the issue.
 It has been observed that relying solely on onchange events based on object
 contracts can lead to unexpected updates and values, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Calculation-spread-over-objects-1"

\end_inset

.
 To address this issue, developers often add logic to determine when to
 update variables.
 Many modern applications use tools like

 derived from variable values.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Statechart"

, these tools allow specifying updates not only when an event occurs but
 also based on the exact state of the application, which is derived from
 previous interactions.
 However, this approach still relies on centralized management of the applicatio
n's state, making it a monolithic approach.

The provided strategy enables many patterns.
 One such strategy is to develop a single calculation procedure that can
 be implemented and called in response to field change events.
 However, this approach has the disadvantage of recomputing fields even
 when they do not need to be recomputed, which can lead to performance issues
 and unnecessary re-rendering of field values that have not been updated.
 Furthermore, a single calculation procedure can become overly complex and
 difficult to maintain as the application grows.

The dataflow paradigm provide frameworks to explicity specify the data dependenc

 In the FRP paradigm data dependencies are composed as pure functions.
 Alternatively, events streams frameworks, such as ReactiveX, enable to
 function over the streams, such that each each stream produces its values
 depending on the values of the input streams.
 It is often claimed that, in order to provde

The observer pattern can be used with the iterator pattern to provide observable

 Observables streams push values notifications to their subsribers.
 On top of it, operators over observable stream, produce values to subseuent
 subscribers, based on the input observable streams.
\end_layout

\begin_inset ERT

However, some applications, including the example we provided, inherently
 have cycles in their data dependencies

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, ensuring that the dependency graph is acyclic becomes a challenge,
 and it limits the ability to separate the code.
 Developers need to be aware of data dependencies and detect existing paths
 before adding new formulas that involve existing variables to prevent cycles.
 For example, if there are already two formulas, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{Y:=Z+1}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lstinline{Z:=X-1}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and the developer wants to add a third formula 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{X:=Y+1}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, they must have access to all three formulas and detect the existing cycle
 among nodes

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Consequently, it is not possible to establish boundaries that prevent access
 to the formulas, which can lead to a monolithic codebase.

However, many applications, as our example, have cycles by their nature

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, in order to ensure that the graph is acyclic, the ability
 to seperate the code is reduced.
 Because, in order to ensure that the graph is acyclic, developers must
 ensure that no node has a path leading back to itself.
 This requires the developer to have knowledge of data dependencies and
 to detect existing paths before adding new formulas that involve existing
 variables.
 If a cycle is detected, the developer should avoid adding the new formula
 to the graph to prevent the creation of a cycle.
 For instance, if there are already two formulas, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinline{Y:=Z+1}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

, and 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 If a calculation is linked to a variable, but the variable has dependencies
 that fall under a separate concern, it is linked without considering those
 dependencies.
 This means that the graph may not necessarily be acyclic.

In front-end applications, developers may create a data dependency graph

 However, in certain scenarios where the application's data dependencies
 are complex, a centralized or monolithic graph might be required.
 This means that the data dependency definitions are located in a single
 code base that cannot be separated, or the runtime relies on an intermediary
