The new variant of FRP possesses the characteristic of referential transparency,
 which is a fundamental property of FRP.
 This ensures predictability because the behavior remains consistent based
 on the input.
 Unless several issues, the referential transparency property is almost
 achieved in the observable streams model, because the output streams are
 calculated from pure functions.

 In the case of mutual recursion, it is necessary for at least one of the
 variables to require the merge function.

In some cases of mutual recursion, it is possible that one of the variables

 In the given example, a subsequent statements

The behavior of pushing values ensures that the

 These properties guarantee that the order of applying the statements does
 not affect the final result.
 In this particular example, executing 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=D}$
\end_inset

 first yields the same result as executing it later, as

 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the
 constraint hierarchy model for GUI—is identical.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this thesis, we aimed to strike a balance between abstraction and control
 in value propagation.
 Our framework provides a high-level language based on FRP, accompanied
 by a general propagation algorithm that ensures a defined update sequence.
 While the drug administration example demonstrates clear business logic,
 encompassing defined objects, variables, and calculations, the propagation
 algorithms may not fulfill business requirements for other applications.
 Moreover, performance considerations (non-functional requirements) may
 necessitate modifying the update order, such as lowering consistency levels
 for resource-intensive computations.

 two drug administration examples: one using rivarjs and the other using
 hotdrink.
 Upon observation, both implementations exhibit similar behavior.
 Once a field is updated, the fields that relied on the previous input,
 specifically the oldest input, are overwritten.
 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the
 constraint hierarchy model for GUI—is identical.

To evaluate the approach, we first implemented (https://rivarx.github.io/UsageExam
ples/) the drug administration presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Background"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

.
 As ilustarted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Drug-Administration-UML-2"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we have splited the drug administration form into two distinct objects.
 Each object is responsible for managing only the variables and relationships
 that are directly relevant to it.
 For instance, the concentration of the bag is hidden from the pump because
 the pump object only interacts directly with the bag's drug and volume.
 Conversely, the concentration is only indirectly communicated with the
 pump since it is updated from changes in the amount or volume.
 According to this example, if the propogation algorithm is sufficient,
 we achived our goal.

Propogation Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our implementation, we provided a strict general propogation algorithm,
 to provide the developers to sepcify clear logic.
 In the drug administration example, the business logic is well specified:
 the objects, the variables, and how they are calculated from each other.
 However, the order of the updates are strict to our implementation.
 there may be domain-specific requirements for other orders for the updates.
 In addition, performance considerations (non functional requirements) may
 require changing the order of the updates, such as reducing consistency
 levels for heavy calculations.
 now we will weaken this argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The state of the art
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is like previous works had to face the balancing between the abstraction
 level and the generalism of the propogation algorithm.
 The technaogy that enables completely custom propogation, has a problematic
 abstraction.
 Event-driven programming theortecaly provide customizable propagation.
 Hoever, the paradigm is error prone, so that it hard to realy customize
 according to the needs.
 Therfore, it is not new that the customizability, is by only choose a general
 propogation strategy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In working with streams such like like ReactiveX.
 In reactiveX, the developer can choose between several scueduler, to indicate
 the order of the updates.
 Hwoever, in working with streams, there is has the same general time problem
 we have in the events driven.
 Here, it is called

.
 In the industry libraries, as can be seen in ReactiveX and Sodium, there
 is either an inpredictable merge function or that the developer need to
 specify the method to merge

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the FRP field reserach, the centeral high level concept is that the developer
s need only to specify the data dependencies, and the runtime maintain the
 updates.
 saying that the the runtime handles the non functional requirements, and
 the developer is free to handle only the functional equirements.
 Suprisngly, the general algorithm handles also some functional requirements,
 and also some non functional requirements break the neat abstraction.
 The root causes are glitches and cycles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Glitches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Glitch means an extra recomputation then expected.
 This is not only the extra work, that affect the perfomance, but also that
 the values that are based on stale values, until the last recomutation.
 There are several glicthes types,that arerelated to the required level
 of the consistency.
 So, this is a functional requirement, depending on the applicaton business.
 Hwever, it is handled strictly by the runtime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In order to customize the way in which to evaluate cycles, the abstracion
 is not totaly high.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our approach can be implemented (as we already implemented) as internal
 dsl, based on the existing popular frameworks.
 the comunication between the nodes is based on a simpler observer chanel.
 theoreticaly, the developers can debug the updates (however, in our implementat
ion, it is still not the case, because we use the framework that implemented
 the streams with schduler, and not completly directly method calls.
 theoreticaly, the nodes can cumunicate efficiently over a wire chanel,
 because the protocal (propogation algorthm) is peer to peer (means no madiator).
 The only limitation, is that the external input will be atached with an
 order, such that each input is atached with the incerenetal number.
 In large network, it might be a bottleneck.

second, our resulted libraries actualy produces a framework for decenterlized
 constraints systems.
 We provide the ability to declare one-way dataflow constraints targeting
 to variables that we do not own.
 While the entire system maintain the whole constraints as in hirarchial
 constraints systems.

 In contrast, our method provides a decentrelized constraints system, the

 Consequently, with the two methods, the developer needs to specify one-way
 constraints.
 However, it has been augmented that it is more correct to specify two-way
 constraints, because several one-way constraints defined separately might
 define inconsistent requirements

 We leave this for future work.
 For this stage we provide two arguments to the claim.
 First, according to the motivating example, we need the option to write
 the one-way constraints separately.
 Second, the method should be used in a programming language that supports
 OOP.
 Consequently, it should not be hard to implement a wrapper class
