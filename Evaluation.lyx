\begin_layout Section
Procedural Programming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In creating Drug Administration application, and keep values of the fields
 consistent, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{calculate}$
\end_inset

 procedure is created.
 This procedure is called whenever the user updates the value of any of
 the fields.
 Depending on the fields that the user edits, the other fields are calculated,
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Centerlized-Calculation-1"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this method there is redundancy.
 Values are calculated, even when their fields are unchanged.
 In addition, statements are repeated, as seen in

Drug administration calculation.
 The code shows how to calculate the values of the fields based on different
 combinations of three input fields.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to eliminate redundancy, a dedicated change event can be created
 for each field.
 Small functions containing the relevant calculations are registered to
 handle these events.
 In this way not all the values are calculated in response to an update
 by the user.
 Instead, it's possible for each field change event to trigger the recalculation
 of only those fields whose values are derived from the updated values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this method causes another form of redundancy.
 Taking the example in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Statechart"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 of implementing 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{x:=y+z}$
\end_inset

, the recalculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE x$
\end_inset

 needs to be triggered both when 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE y$
\end_inset

 is updated and when 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE z$
\end_inset

 is updated.
 The calls to recalculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE x$
\end_inset

 are repeated within the two handlers of the change events for 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE z$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, in cases where a field relies on multiple fields, the registrations
 to recalculate it must be duplicated across the various change events of
 the fields it depends on.
 This places the responsibility on developers to meticulously ensure that
 no registration is overlooked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Spreadsheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We implemented the Drug Administration example in a 
\begin_inset Formula $\NAME{Spreadsheet}$
\end_inset

, available in 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://github.com/RIVarX/Evaluation/DrugAdministration.xlsx 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Each cell can contain either a formula or a value.
 This leads to implement several modes to the drug administration.
 In the first mode, users set the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Concentration}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Volume}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Duration}$
\end_inset

, and the other fields are calculated.
 In the second mode, users set the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Dose}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Rate}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Duration}$
\end_inset

, and once again, the other fields are calculated.
 This pattern can continue for additional modes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implementation has redundancy across the different modes, as several
 cells calculate the values of the same real-world variable.
 This is in contrast to the traditional OOP, where objects commonly store
 variables that mirror real-world attributes or variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We developed the Drug Administration application using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\NAME{Hotdrink}$
\end_inset

 library.
 However, the library currently lacks support for reusable components 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "marheim2017domain"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if we need to create another application based on an this one
 without modifying impacting the existing clients, we need to clone the
 existing codebase and then making the necessary changes to the new application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike our approach, the alternatives suffer from code duplication in three
 main patterns.
 First, there is duplication when updating variables in different locations,
 like in response to events.
 Second, multiple variables are used to represent a single real-world variable.
 Finally, code is cloned to avoid affecting existing clients.
 With our approach, developers can work without repetition, allowing the
 organization's business logic to be specified in the code as a 
\emph on
single source of truth
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We recognize in the exploration three patterns of code duplication.
 First, calling to update variables in various locations, such as in response
 to events.
 Second, multiple variables to represent a single real-world variable.
 Finaly, cloning code to not affect existing clients.
 Since we could not prevent code repretition, we cannot provide a
\emph on
 single source of truth
\emph default
 for the organization's business logic.

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The code snippest generates 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{VisualRIVar}$
\end_inset

, a react component that takes two props: 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{rivar}$
\end_inset

 and a render prop function.
 The render prop function is used to render the child component.
 The render prop function is passed an object with two properties: value
 and change.
 The value property is the current value of the Rivar variable.
 The change function can be used to update the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{rivar}$
\end_inset

 variable.
 In the sample app, the code will render an input field that is connected
 to the rivar variable.
 When the user changes the value of the input field, the rivar variable
 will be updated.
 The rivar variable will then update the value prop of the input field.
 This will cause the input field to be re-rendered with the updated value.
 This pattern can be used to render any type of component inline and nested
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{VisualRIVar}$
\end_inset

 component.

Propogation Algorithm

In our implementation, we provided a strict general propogation algorithm,
 to provide the developers to sepcify clear logic.
 In the drug administration example, the business logic is well specified:
 the objects, the variables, and how they are calculated from each other.
 However, the order of the updates are strict to our implementation.
 there may be domain-specific requirements for other orders for the updates.
 In addition, performance considerations (non functional requirements) may
 require changing the order of the updates, such as reducing consistency
 levels for heavy calculations.
 now we will weaken this argument.

This is like previous works had to face the balancing between the abstraction

 The technaogy that enables completely custom propogation, has a problematic

 Event-driven programming theortecaly provide customizable propagation.
 Hoever, the paradigm is error prone, so that it hard to realy customize
 according to the needs.
 Therfore, it is not new that the customizability, is by only choose a general
 propogation strategy.

Basicly, as

 consists of an observable stream, when a UI change event occurs, it adds
 an event to the variable stream.
 Conversely, when a new event appears in the stream, it triggers a corresponding

 However in

 In

 This helps to reduce code repetition, becuse without this ability, the

 Another alternative is to not add calculations to existing fields, but
 to add new fields to the new needs, causes repetition in the fields.

The traditional alternative to register code to update fields might lead
 to cycles.
 Consequently, we need to take care of the any location taht have access

 code repetition.

 The impact of a good seperation is, that if the business needs to provide

 The reason is that changes might disturb existing clients.
 Consequently, if there is a need to change, it leads to clone the codebase.

 Previously, we could either add another variables to not disturb the clients,
 or add the functionality to update the exiting fields with the risk of
 an accidetal recursion, that will harm exisitng clients.
 In order to ot harm the clients, we could duplicate the component, and
 adjust the new component to the need.

 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the

In this thesis, we aimed to strike a balance between abstraction and control
 in value propagation.
 Our framework provides a high-level language based on FRP, accompanied
 by a general propagation algorithm that ensures a defined update sequence.
 While the drug administration example demonstrates clear business logic,
 encompassing defined objects, variables, and calculations, the propagation
 algorithms may not fulfill business requirements for other applications.
 Moreover, performance considerations (non-functional requirements) may
 necessitate modifying the update order, such as lowering consistency levels
 for resource-intensive computations.

 two drug administration examples: one using rivarjs and the other using
 hotdrink.
 Upon observation, both implementations exhibit similar behavior.
 Once a field is updated, the fields that relied on the previous input,
 specifically the oldest input, are overwritten.
 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the

 Consequently, with the two methods, the developer needs to specify one-way
 constraints.
 However, it has been augmented that it is more correct to specify two-way
 constraints, because several one-way constraints defined separately might

 We leave this for future work.

 the one-way constraints separately.
 Second, the method should be used in a programming language that supports
 OOP.
 Consequently, it should not be hard to implement a wrapper class

Our implementation includes a general propagation algorithm that enables
 developers to define clear logic.
 In the drug administration example, the business logic is well-defined,
 including the objects, variables, and how they are calculated.
 However, our implementation follows a strict order of updates, which may
 not meet specific requirements for other domains.
 In addition, performance considerations (non functional requirements) may
