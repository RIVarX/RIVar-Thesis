  abstract = {The current demands for seamless connections with the surrounding environment make software more reactive. For example, such demands are evident in systems consisting of the Internet of Things. Such systems include a set of reactive values that are periodically updated in response to external or internal events to form a dataflow in the sense that such updates are propagated to other reactive values. Two effective approaches for realizing such reactive values have been proposed: the event mechanisms in event-based programming and the signals in functional-reactive programming. These two approaches are now becoming mixed in several languages such as Flapjax and REScala, which makes these languages notably expressive for modularizing the implementation of reactive software. For example, REScala provides a rich API that consists of functions converting events to signals and vice versa. In this paper, we explore another, simpler approach in the design space of reactive programming languages: the event mechanism is harmonized with signals, resulting in a simplified programming interface that is mostly based on signals. Based on this approach, we realize SignalJ, a simple extension of Java with events and signals. Our notable findings are (1) an event can be represented as an update of a signal and (2) such an effectful signal can be represented using annotations instead of introducing types and constructors for signals to further simplify the language. Another contribution of this paper is the formal model of SignalJ. As both mechanisms of events and signals may interfere with each other, this mixing sometimes results in surprising behavior. For example, the functional behavior of signals is affected by the imperative features of events. Thus, understanding the formal model of this mixing is actually important. The core calculus, Featherweight SignalJ (FSJ), was developed as an extension of Featherweight Java, and proofs are provided to ensure the soundness of FSJ.},

  abstract   = {Context: Micro-Frontends are increasing in popularity, being adopted by several large companies, such as DAZN, Ikea, Starbucks and may others. Micro-Frontends enable splitting of monolithic frontends into independent and smaller micro applications. However, many companies are still hesitant to adopt Micro-Frontends, due to the lack of knowledge concerning their benefits. Additionally, provided online documentation is often times perplexed and contradictory. Objective: The goal of this work is to map the existing knowledge on Micro-Frontends, by understanding the motivations of companies when adopting such applications as well as possible benefits and issues. Method: For this purpose, we surveyed the academic and grey literature by means of the Multivocal Literature Review process, analysing 173 sources, of which 43 reported motivations, benefits and issues. Results: The results show that existing architectural options to build web applications are cumbersome if the application and development team grows, and if multiple teams need to develop the same frontend application. In such cases, companies adopted Micro-Frontends to increase team independence and to reduce the overall complexity of the frontend. The application of the Micro-Frontend, confirmed the expected benefits, and Micro-Frontends resulted to provide the same benefits as microservices on the back end side, combining the development team into a fully cross-functional development team that can scale processes when needed. However, Micro-Frontends also showed some issues, such as the increased payload size of the application, increased code duplication and coupling between teams, and monitoring complexity. Conclusions: Micro-Frontends allow companies to scale development according to business needs in the same way microservices do with the back end side. In addition, Micro-Frontends have a lot of overhead and require careful planning if an advantage is achieved by using Micro-Frontends. Further research is needed to carefully investigate this new hype, by helping practitioners to understand how to use Micro-Frontends as well as understand in which contexts they are the most beneficial.},

By adopting the micro frontends approach and designing your web apps as systems of features, you can deliver faster feature development, easier upgrades, and pick and choose the technology you use in your stack. Micro Frontends in Action is your guide to simplifying unwieldy frontends by composing them from small, well-defined units.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.  About the Technology  Micro frontends deliver the same flexibility and maintainability to browser-based applications that microservices provide for backend systems. You design your project as a set of standalone components that include their own interfaces, logic, and storage. Then you develop these mini-applications independently and compose them in the browser.  About the Book  Micro Frontends in Action teaches you to apply the microservices approach to the frontend. You’ll start with the core micro frontend design ideas. Then, you’ll build an e-commerce application, working through practical issues like server-side and client-side composition, routing, and maintaining a consistent look and feel. Finally, you’ll explore team workflow patterns that maximize the benefit of developing application components independently.  What’s Inside  - Create a unified frontend from independent applications - Combine JavaScript code from multiple frameworks - Browser and server-side composition and routing - Implement effective dev teams and project workflow  About the Reader  For web developers, software architects, and team leaders.

Its drawbacks are well-documented and two families of alternative approaches have been proposed, extending object-oriented languages with concepts from functional reactive and dataflow programming, respectively event-driven programming. The former hardly escape the functional setting; the latter do not achieve the declarativeness of more functional approaches. In this paper, we present REScala, a reactive language which integrates concepts from event-based and functional-reactive programming into the object-oriented world. REScala supports the development of reactive applications by fostering a functional declarative style which complements the advantages of object-oriented design.},
