\begin_layout Standard
In this section we compare the created framework to the traditional programming
 paradigms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FRP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduced a new variant for FRP, that its main difference is in the
 approach to support cycles, by enabling multiple assignments.
 In this section we accosiate several concepts in the field to the the new
 variant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Referential Transparency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Background"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, in FRP, the concept is inspired from the functional paradigm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blackheath2016functional"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Saying 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=B+1}$
\end_inset

 is like stating that 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE A$
\end_inset

 is a function with a body of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{B+1}$
\end_inset

, so that each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE A$
\end_inset

 is derived from the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE B$
\end_inset

.
 This produces a 
\emph on
predictability 
\emph default
property due to 
\emph on
referential transparency
\emph default
, meaning the input consistently produces the same output 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blackheath2016functional"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in our approach it is enabled to associate several expressions
 to the same variable, so saying 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=B+1}$
\end_inset

 can be added with 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=C+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Which means that we cannot derive the predictability property as it has
 traditionaly achieved in the field.
 Insead, the predictability property is achieved from introducing the pure
 functions over streams, as each variable consists of a streams of values
 that produced from the merge function described in

Glitch Freedom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to manage glitches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bainomugisha2013survey"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, previous approaches managed the values correctly at runtime by holding
 an acyclic graph in memory and updating each variable only after all its
 dependencies have been updated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bainomugisha2013survey"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is against our approach to support cycles.
 Other algorithms also do not fit our settings, because they depend on a
 central algorithm that holds in memory the data structure that represent
 the data dependencies

, but they do not support cycles, so we left them irrelevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take the prescpective that glitches are simultaneous events or values
 from the same time that arrive at a variable to be updated at different
 times 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blackheath2016functional"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We noticed that this is like unexpected feedback loops, when also values
 arrive at a variable to be updated at different times.
 we expanded it to an overall order over the values, so that each values
 will be passed (i.e., propogated) only if it is freshed, i.e, its time is
 greater from the previous values that has been passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also inspired from that glitches has the mean of consistency.
 Each application can have different consistency level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "margara2018semantics"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the current approach, that the variables manage their values as streams,
 we are more open to customize the consistency level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Merge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Merge operations have been considered in software engineering before, similar
 to the merge operation introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Method"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In working with streams, the merge operation has the the same general problem
 as in the events paradigm, on how to handle the time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "abelson1996structure"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the two paradigms, there is the difficulty to how to merge values from
 several sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{merge}$
\end_inset

 operation from 
\begin_inset Formula $\NAME{RxJS}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{Merge}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\ReactiveX$
\end_inset

), whenever there is a value from any of the sources, it is passed to the
 output stream.
 This is unpredictable, as it does not handle correctly the simultaneous
 values.
 This leads (as implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $\NAME{sodium}$
\end_inset

) that the developers need to provide the method on how to determine the
 order of the values

\begin_layout Paragraph
Abstraction Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All frameworks that support custom propagation must strike a balance between
 abstraction and generality.
 Event-driven programming frameworks give developers complete control over
 the propagation order, but this can be error-prone 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $\ReactiveX$

 several schedulers to indicate the order of updates.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 FRP frameworks go even further, abstracting away the propagation order
 altogether and allowing developers to focus on specifying the data dependencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, due to the cycles issue, the previous implementations have exceptions
 that break this abstraction level.

Cycles

There are two opposing methods about cycles.
 In one method, cycles are avoided, because the paradigm derived from the

 According to the second method, forbidding cycles makes FRP unacceptably
 weak, because many applications have cycles by their nature

 The impact of a good seperation is, that if the business needs to provide
 a component that is based on an existing one, it is an addition, not a
 change.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In our context, a good seperation should support adding fields calculations,
 without to distrub the existing ones.
 By associating FRP to the fields calculations, can we describe the existing
 fields calculations by a data dependenciy graph.
 Consequently, adding fields is determind as adding vertexes, and adding
 dependencies is determind as adding edges between the vertexes.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In order to improve front ends usability, we suggests to improve the ability
 to inject business logic of variables and fields calculations.
 We use the FRP paradigm as the framework to create the fields calculations.
 However, the semantics in FRP does not cover required cases.
 First, to extend an existing application by adding dependencies.
 Second, to enable variables to get values from more than one source.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The new variant of FRP possesses the characteristic of referential transparency,
 which is a fundamental property of FRP.
 This ensures predictability because the behavior remains consistent based
 on the input.
 Unless several issues, the referential transparency property is almost
 achieved in the observable streams model, because the output streams are
 calculated from pure functions.

Furthermore, as mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the issues related to glitches, simultaneous events, and recursions have
 already been tackled through the modeling of an order and the implementation
 of a filter mechanism.
 Additionally, we address the need for a

In some cases of mutual recursion, it is possible that one of the variables
 within the cycle has a second (or more) assignment, through which the propagati
on is initiated.
 Because subsequent statements with assignments to the same variable accumulate
 and merge more streams into it.
 In the given example, a subsequent statements 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=D}$
\end_inset

 is executed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A=merge(A,D)}$
\end_inset

 which means that

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The behavior of pushing values ensures that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{merge}$
\end_inset

 operator exhibits the properties of associativity, commutativity, and flattenin
g.
 These properties guarantee that the order of applying the statements does
 not affect the final result.
 In this particular example, executing 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{A:=D}$
\end_inset

 first yields the same result as executing it later, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\LSTINLINE{merge(merge(A,B),D)=merge(merge(A,D),B)=merge(A,B,D)}$

This leads to the referential transparency property, which is a characteristic
 of FRP.
 It has been determined that the output streams are calculated from pure
 functions, thus maintaining referential transparency.
 It can also be observed that the principles that block the observable streams

As a result, the new variant of FRP support multiple assignments.
 A variable with multiple assignments is interpreted as a merge operator
 over the variable and assigned expressions in the various statements.
 This is like a methodology that involves the variable inferring its value
 over time from various streams of samples.
 This leads also to the functional transparency

 Because it has been determined, that the output streams are calculated

Our work builds upon of

 This assignment operation replaces the calculation, stopping the old source
 in order to start responding to the new source.
 This is in contrast to the declarative and functional approach originating
 in FRP, where programs should "describe things that exist, rather than
 actions that have happened or are to happen (i.e., what is, not what does)"

We give the answer mentioned through this thesis by that an assignment should
 be enabled everywhere with the meaning of adding the dependencies.
 This answer is provided following the consideration whether a subclass
 should be allowed to override dependencies defined in its parent.
 If a subclass changes the behavior of its super class, the resulting type
 does not inherit the entire behavior of the parent.
 Therefore, we have defined that the assignment only adds dependencies without
 overriding old ones.
 As a result, the resulting object derives its entire functionality from
 the hierarchy.
 As mentioned, the polymorphism means that the dynamic type will capture
 the dependencies

 By our merge operation, each new sample from any of the sources are passed
 to the target variable, which recursively pass new values to targets variables.
 Consequently, in fields calculations, once the user puts a new input for
 a field, the fields that rely on a previous input, specifically the oldest
 input, are overwritten.

Comparing to Constraints Systems

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This thesis is like constraints systems, providing consistency between variables.
 However in constraints systems, developer are forced to one block of code
 that run on a single machine, while this thesis provides modular architecture.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In constraints systems, we can declare 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

A=B+C
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and each user update, to any of the variables, follows an automatic update
 to the left variables.
 With the proposed Rivars, it is implemented by declaring three formulas:
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

A:=B+C
\end_layout

, 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

C:=A-B
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 However, the long verbosity exists also in constraints systems, when developers
 need specifying methods to satisfy the constraints.
 In addition, building blocks can easily built on top of our thesis.
 This means more extensions can be implemented by combining several formulas
 into a single constraint.
\end_layout

\begin_inset ERT

 to the left variables.
 However, it is not clear what variable's value should be changed, especially
 when both other variables are not empty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The same question is arisen when declaring RIvar' formulas

 Our merge method produce variable's values according to the total order
 over the propogated values, that is derived from a total order over the
 external input events.
 In other words, values produced from old events are overidden by new ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, first, constraints systems handle consistency according 
\emph on

\emph default
 consraints, that is to ignore constraints if they belong to the low levels
 of hierarchy.
 Second, they consider external inputs as constraints, for example the constrain

 with 
\begin_inset ERT

 Third, external inputs' constraints are set in the hierarchy, according
 to the events' order.

Consequently, the decision what variables to update in the automatic updates
 seems the same.

 equations, providing runtime automates to automate variables' updates,
 they support cycles and several assignments, and that they handle the variables

Hotdrink needs for each input, to run against the entire constraints and

 This algorithm is executed by a madiator coupling the entire variables

 As mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In contrast, our method provides a decentrelized constraints system, the
 variables observe their sources and update their values by regular objects'
 messages.
 Consequently, by nature, relations between variables can be specified,
 even when variables are located in diffrent components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

Hotdrink handles two-way constraints while our method handle one-way constraints.
 As explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to satisfy the two-way constraints.
 Consequently, with the two methods, the developer needs to specify one-way
 constraints.
 However, it has been augmented that it is more correct to specify two-way
 constraints, because several one-way constraints defined separately might
 define inconsistent requirements

 We leave this for future work.
 For this stage we provide two arguments to the claim.
 First, according to the motivating example, we need the option to write
 the one-way constraints separately.
 Second, the method should be used in a programming language that supports
 OOP.
 Consequently, it should not be hard to implement a wrapper class

 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the
 constraint hierarchy model for GUI—is identical.

Furthermore, we guarantee that the same sequence of events consistently
 produces the same results, achieving properties characterized by FRP.
 FRP is originally described as functions over reactive variables, with

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this thesis, we aimed to strike a balance between abstraction and control
 in value propagation.
 Our framework provides a high-level language based on FRP, accompanied
 by a general propagation algorithm that ensures a defined update sequence.
 While the drug administration example demonstrates clear business logic,
 encompassing defined objects, variables, and calculations, the propagation
 algorithms may not fulfill business requirements for other applications.
 Moreover, performance considerations (non-functional requirements) may
 necessitate modifying the update order, such as lowering consistency levels
 for resource-intensive computations.

 two drug administration examples: one using rivarjs and the other using
 hotdrink.
 Upon observation, both implementations exhibit similar behavior.
 Once a field is updated, the fields that relied on the previous input,
 specifically the oldest input, are overwritten.
 In the case of Hotdrink, the addition of new input triggers the creation
 of an equation constraint at the highest level of the hierarchy, involving
 the variable and the input.
 Plans are then generated, with each plan recursively searching for equations
 where the left variables are determined by preceding equations.
 The plan that satisfies the most constraints in the hierarchy is selected
 and executed.
 This aligns with our propagation approach, as we continue propagating values
 derived from the highest priority values.
 Consequently, the update sequence for both methods—our framework and the
 constraint hierarchy model for GUI—is identical.

To evaluate the approach, we first implemented (https://rivarx.github.io/UsageExam
ples/) the drug administration presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Background"
plural "false"
caps "false"

.
 As ilustarted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Drug-Administration-UML-2"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we have splited the drug administration form into two distinct objects.
 Each object is responsible for managing only the variables and relationships
 that are directly relevant to it.
 For instance, the concentration of the bag is hidden from the pump because
 the pump object only interacts directly with the bag's drug and volume.
 Conversely, the concentration is only indirectly communicated with the
 pump since it is updated from changes in the amount or volume.
 According to this example, if the propogation algorithm is sufficient,
 we achived our goal.

second, our resulted libraries actualy produces a framework for decenterlized
 constraints systems.
 We provide the ability to declare one-way dataflow constraints targeting
 to variables that we do not own.
 While the entire system maintain the whole constraints as in hirarchial
 constraints systems.

In this section, we compare our method to Hotdrink mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

.
 As mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

caps "true"
noprefix "false"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, FRP and so our method are similar to Hotdrink in that they share declare
 equations, providing runtime automates to automate variables' updates,
 they support cycles and several assignments, and that they handle the variables
' values according to the order of the input.
 Our method is diffrent from Hotdrink in that it is a 
\emph on
decenterlized
\emph default
 constraints system, and that it handles one-way constraints.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
decenterlized constraints system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hotdrink needs for each input, to run against the entire constraints and
 existing values, to generate a new dependancy graph according to the variables'
 existing values.
 This algorithm is executed by a madiator coupling the entire variables
 and dependencies.

, this design causes applications to not being reused.
 In other words, Hotdrink can be used only to building monolith applications

.
 In contrast, our method provides a decentrelized constraints system, the
 variables observe their sources and update their values by regular objects'
 messages.
 Consequently, by nature, relations between variables can be specified,
 even when variables are located in diffrent components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
one-way constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hotdrink handles two-way constraints while our method handle one-way constraints.
 As explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:ConstraintsInBackground"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the two-way constraints need attached one-way constraints, that are the
 
\emph on
methods 
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to satisfy the two-way constraints.
 Consequently, with the two methods, the developer needs to specify one-way
 constraints.
 However, it has been augmented that it is more correct to specify two-way
 constraints, because several one-way constraints defined separately might
 define inconsistent requirements

.
 We leave this for future work.
 For this stage we provide two arguments to the claim.
 First, according to the motivating example, we need the option to write
 the one-way constraints separately.
 Second, the method should be used in a programming language that supports
 OOP.
 Consequently, it should not be hard to implement a wrapper class
